Andrew Ng 교수님의 명강의를 노트해봤다. (아직 미완성글)

***

## **Lecture 1.2 - Introduction Supervised Learning**

Supervised Learning: 데이터에 대한 명시적인 정답(Label)이 주어진 상태에서 컴퓨터를 학습시키는 방법

ex1)

![price](/images/posts/2020-02-26-ai/price.png){:width="80%"}{: .center}

Predict price by size in feet

ex2)

![tumor1](/images/posts/2020-02-26-ai/tumor1.png){:width="70%"}{: .center}
![tumor2](/images/posts/2020-02-26-ai/tumor2.png){:width="60%"}{: .center}

Predict the probability that a tumor is toxic based on the size of the tumor
(number of features can be a big number)

## **Lecture 1.3 - Introduction UnSupervised Learning**

DNA microarray data<br>
The idea is you have a group of different individuals and for each of them, you measure how much they do or do not have a certain gene technically you measure how much of certain genes are expressed.<br>
Clustering is a representative example.<br>
Cocktail party problem algorithm<br>
```
[W,s,v] = svd((repmat(sum(x.*x,1),size(x,1),1).*x)*x’);
```
